Entonces es crucial hacer que la lectura sea la m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil posible. Esto se hace con comentarios dentro del c\u00f3digo que explican lo que uno est\u00e1 haciendo, sobre todo cuando nos es evidente. Adem\u00e1s, un error muy frecuente en programaci\u00f3n es escribir un programa a veces muy inteligente, pero sin comentar nada, y 6 meses despu\u00e9s cuando necesita usarlo de nuevo y que no funciona, no poder entender nada dentro de este c\u00f3digo complicad\u00edsimo. Me ha pasado varias veces, y la \u00fanica salida en este caso es pasar una semana tratando de entender de nuevo lo que uno estaba tratando de hacer con este maldito programa. **O, comentar desde el principio, y ahorrarse mucho tiempo :-).**"

        "Ivan Sergyevitch Turgenev came of an old stock of the Russian nobility.\n",
        "He was born in Orel, in the province of Orel, which lies more than a\n",
        "hundred miles south of Moscow, on October 28, 1818. His education was\n",
        "begun by tutors at home in the great family mansion in the town of\n",
        "Spask, and he studied later at the universities of Moscow, St.\n",
        "Petersburg, and Berlin. The influence of the last, and of the\n",
        "compatriots with whom he associated there, was very great; and when he\n",
        "returned to Moscow in 1841, he was ambitious to teach Hegel to the\n",
        "students there. Before this could be arranged, however, he entered the\n",
        "Ministry of the Interior at St. Petersburg. While there his interests\n",
        "turned more and more toward literature. He wrote verses and comedies,\n",
        "read George Sand, and made the acquaintance of Dostoevsky and the\n",
        "critic Bielinski. His mother, a tyrannical woman with an ungovernable\n",
        "temper, was eager that he should make a brilliant official career; so,\n",
        "when he resigned from the Ministry in 1845, she showed her disapproval\n",

        "Sportsman's Sketches,\" the book that first brought him reputation. The\n",
        "first of these papers appeared in 1847, and in the same year he left\n",
        "Russia in the train of Pauline Viardot, a singer and actress, to whom\n",
        "he had been devoted for three or four years and with whom he maintained\n",
        "relations for the rest of his life. For a year or two he lived chiefly\n",
        "in Paris or at a country house at Courtavenel in Brie, which belonged\n",
        "to Madame Viardot; but in 1850 he returned to Russia. His experiences\n",
        "were not such as to induce him to repatriate himself permanently. He\n",

        "arrested and imprisoned for a short time, and for the next two years\n",
        "kept under police surveillance. Meantime he continued to write, and by\n",
        "the time that the close of the Crimean War made it possible for him\n",
        "again to go to western Europe, he was recognized as standing at the\n",

        "posting station, a fine property of two hundred souls, or, as he\n",
        "expressed it--since he had arranged the division of his land with the\n",
        "peasants, and started 'a farm'--of nearly five thousand acres. His\n",
        "father, a general in the army, who served in 1812, a coarse,\n",
        "half-educated, but not ill-natured man, a typical Russian, had been in\n",
        "harness all his life, first in command of a brigade, and then of a\n",
        "division, and lived constantly in the provinces, where, by virtue of\n",
        "his rank, he played a fairly important part. Nikolai Petrovitch was\n",
        "born in the south of Russia like his elder brother, Pavel, of whom more\n",
        "hereafter. He was educated at home till he was fourteen, surrounded by\n",
        "cheap tutors, free-and-easy but toadying adjutants, and all the usual\n",
        "regimental and staff set. His mother, one of the Kolyazin family, as a\n",
        "girl called Agathe, but as a general's wife Agathokleya Kuzminishna\n",
        "Kirsanov, was one of those military ladies who take their full share of\n",
        "the duties and dignities of office. She wore gorgeous caps and rustling\n",
        "silk dresses; in church she was the first to advance to the cross; she\n",
        "talked a great deal in a loud voice, let her children kiss her hand in\n",
        "the morning, and gave them her blessing at night--in fact, she got\n",
        "everything out of life she could. Nikolai Petrovitch, as a general's\n",
        "son--though so far from being distinguished by courage that he even\n",
        "deserved to be called 'a funk'--was intended, like his brother Pavel,\n",
        "to enter the army; but he broke his leg on the very day when the news\n",
        "of his commission came, and, after being two months in bed, retained a\n",
        "slight limp to the end of his days. His father gave him up as a bad\n",
        "job, and let him go into the civil service. He took him to Petersburg\n",
        "directly he was eighteen, and placed him in the university. His brother\n",
        "happened about the same time to be made an officer in the Guards. The\n",
        "young men started living together in one set of rooms, under the remote\n",
        "supervision of a cousin on their mother's side, Ilya Kolyazin, an\n",
        "official of high rank. Their father returned to his division and his\n",
        "wife, and only rarely sent his sons large sheets of grey paper,\n",
        "scrawled over in a bold clerkly hand. At the bottom of these sheets\n",
        "stood in letters, enclosed carefully in scroll-work, the words, 'Piotr\n",
        "Kirsanov, General-Major.' In 1835 Nikolai Petrovitch left the\n",
        "university, a graduate, and in the same year General Kirsanov was put\n",
        "on to the retired list after an unsuccessful review, and came to\n",
        "Petersburg with his wife to live. He was about to take a house in the\n",
        "Tavrichesky Gardens, and had joined the English club, but he died\n",
        "suddenly of an apoplectic fit. Agathokleya Kuzminishna soon followed\n",
        "him; she could not accustom herself to a dull life in the capital; she\n",
        "was consumed by the ennui of existence away from the regiment.\n",
        "Meanwhile Nikolai Petrovitch had already, in his parents' lifetime and\n",
        "to their no slight chagrin, had time to fall in love with the daughter\n",
        "of his landlord, a petty official, Prepolovensky. She was a pretty and,\n",
        "as it is called, 'advanced' girl; she used to read the serious articles\n",
        "in the 'Science' column of the journals. He married her directly the\n",
        "term of mourning was over; and leaving the civil service in which his\n",
        "father had by favour procured him a post, was perfectly blissful with\n",
        "his Masha, first in a country villa near the Lyesny Institute,\n",
        "afterwards in town in a pretty little flat with a clean staircase and a\n",
        "draughty drawing-room, and then in the country, where he settled\n",
        "finally, and where in a short time a son, Arkady, was born to him. The\n",
        "young couple lived very happily and peacefully; they were scarcely ever\n",
        "apart; they read together, sang and played duets together on the piano;\n",
        "she tended her flowers and looked after the poultry-yard; he sometimes\n",
        "went hunting, and busied himself with the estate, while Arkady grew and\n",
        "grew in the same happy and peaceful way. Ten years passed like a dream.\n",
        "In 1847 Kirsanov's wife died. He almost succumbed to this blow; in a\n",
        "few weeks his hair was grey; he was getting ready to go abroad, if\n",
        "possible to distract his mind ... but then came the year 1848. He\n",
        "returned unwillingly to the country, and, after a rather prolonged\n",
        "period of inactivity, began to take an interest in improvements in the\n",
        "management of his land. In 1855 he brought his son to the university;\n",
        "he spent three winters with him in Petersburg, hardly going out\n",
        "anywhere, and trying to make acquaintance with Arkady's young\n",
        "companions. The last winter he had not been able to go, and here we\n",
        "have him in the May of 1859, already quite grey, stoutish, and rather\n",
        "bent, waiting for his son, who had just taken his degree, as once he\n",
        "had taken it himself.\n",
        "\n",
        "The servant, from a feeling of propriety, and perhaps, too, not anxious\n",
        "to remain under the master's eye, had gone to the gate, and was smoking\n",
        "a pipe. Nikolai Petrovitch bent his head, and began staring at the\n",
        "crumbling steps; a big mottled fowl walked sedately towards him,\n",
        "treading firmly with its great yellow legs; a muddy cat gave him an\n",
        "unfriendly look, twisting herself coyly round the railing. The sun was\n",
        "scorching; from the half-dark passage of the posting station came an\n",
        "odour of hot rye-bread. Nikolai Petrovitch fell to dreaming. 'My son\n",
        "... a graduate ... Arkasha ...' were the ideas that continually came\n",
        "round again and again in his head; he tried to think of something else,\n",
        "and again the same thoughts returned. He remembered his dead wife....\n",
        "'She did not live to see it!' he murmured sadly. A plump, dark-blue\n",
        "pigeon flew into the road, and hurriedly went to drink in a puddle near\n",
        "the well. Nikolai Petrovitch began looking at it, but his ear had\n",
        "already caught the sound of approaching wheels.\n",
        "\n",
        "'It sounds as if they're coming sir,' announced the servant, popping in\n",
        "from the gateway.\n",
        "\n",
        "Nikolai Petrovitch jumped up, and bent his eyes on the road. A carriage\n",
        "appeared with three posting-horses harnessed abreast; in the carriage\n",
        "he caught a glimpse of the blue band of a student's cap, the familiar\n",
        "outline of a dear face.\n",
        "\n",
        "'Arkasha! Arkasha!' cried Kirsanov, and he ran waving his hands.... A\n",
        "few instants later, his lips were pressed to the beardless, dusty,\n",
        "sunburnt-cheek of the youthful graduate.\n",

        "\n",
        "'Let me shake myself first, daddy,' said Arkady, in a voice tired from\n",
        "travelling, but boyish and clear as a bell, as he gaily responded to\n",
        "his father's caresses; 'I am covering you with dust.'\n",
        "\n",
        "'Never mind, never mind,' repeated Nikolai Petrovitch, smiling\n",
        "tenderly, and twice he struck the collar of his son's cloak and his own\n",
        "greatcoat with his hand. 'Let me have a look at you; let me have a look\n",
        "at you,' he added, moving back from him, but immediately he went with\n",
        "hurried steps towards the yard of the station, calling, 'This way, this\n",
        "way; and horses at once.'\n",
        "\n",
        "Nikolai Petrovitch seemed far more excited than his son; he seemed a\n",
        "little confused, a little timid. Arkady stopped him.\n",
        "\n",
        "'Daddy,' he said, 'let me introduce you to my great friend, Bazarov,\n",
        "about whom I have so often written to you. He has been so good as to\n",
        "promise to stay with us.'\n",
        "\n",
        "Nikolai Petrovitch went back quickly, and going up to a tall man in a\n",
        "long, loose, rough coat with tassels, who had only just got out of the\n",
        "carriage, he warmly pressed the ungloved red hand, which the latter did\n",
        "not at once hold out to him.\n",
        "\n",
        "'I am heartily glad,' he began, 'and very grateful for your kind\n",
        "intention of visiting us.... Let me know your name, and your father's.'\n",
        "\n",
        "'Yevgeny Vassilyev,' answered Bazarov, in a lazy but manly voice; and\n",
        "turning back the collar of his rough coat, he showed Nikolai Petrovitch\n",
        "his whole face. It was long and lean, with a broad forehead, a nose\n",
        "flat at the base and sharper at the end, large greenish eyes, and\n",
        "drooping whiskers of a sandy colour; it was lighted up by a tranquil\n",
        "smile, and showed self-confidence and intelligence.\n",
        "\n",
        "'I hope, dear Yevgeny Vassilyitch, you won't be dull with us,'\n",
        "continued Nikolai Petrovitch.\n",
        "\n",
        "Bazarov's thin lips moved just perceptibly, though he made no reply,\n",
        "but merely took off his cap. His long, thick hair did not hide the\n",
        "prominent bumps on his head.\n",
        "\n",
        "'Then, Arkady,' Nikolai Petrovitch began again, turning to his son,\n",
        "'shall the horses be put to at once? or would you like to rest?'\n",
        "\n",
        "'We will rest at home, daddy; tell them to harness the horses.'\n",
        "\n",
        "'At once, at once,' his father assented. 'Hey, Piotr, do you hear? Get\n",
        "things ready, my good boy; look sharp.'\n",
        "\n",
        "Piotr, who as a modernised servant had not kissed the young master's\n",
        "hand, but only bowed to him from a distance, again vanished through the\n",

        "\n",
        "'I came here with the carriage, but there are three horses for your\n",
        "coach too,' said Nikolai Petrovitch fussily, while Arkady drank some\n",
        "water from an iron dipper brought him by the woman in charge of the\n",
        "station, and Bazarov began smoking a pipe and went up to the driver,\n",
        "who was taking out the horses; 'there are only two seats in the\n",
        "carriage, and I don't know how your friend' ...\n",
        "\n",
        "'He will go in the coach,' interposed Arkady in an undertone. 'You must\n",

        "simple--you will see.'\n",
        "\n",
        "Nikolai Petrovitch's coachman brought the horses round.\n",

        "\n",
        "'Do you hear, Mityuha,' put in another driver, standing by with his\n",

        "'Ah! he's in the medical faculty,' observed Nikolai Petrovitch, and he\n",

        "\n",

        "picturesque. Fields upon fields stretched all along to the very\n",
        "horizon, now sloping gently upwards, then dropping down again; in some\n",
        "places woods were to be seen, and winding ravines, planted with low,\n",
        "scanty bushes, recalling vividly the representation of them on the\n",
        "old-fashioned maps of the times of Catherine. They came upon little\n",
        "streams too with hollow banks; and tiny lakes with narrow dykes; and\n",
        "little villages, with low hovels under dark and often tumble-down\n",
        "roofs, and slanting barns with walls woven of brushwood and gaping\n",
        "doorways beside neglected threshing-floors; and churches, some\n",
        "brick-built, with stucco peeling off in patches, others wooden, with\n",
        "crosses fallen askew, and overgrown grave-yards. Slowly Arkady's heart\n",
        "sunk. To complete the picture, the peasants they met were all in\n",
        "tatters and on the sorriest little nags; the willows, with their trunks\n",
        "stripped of bark, and broken branches, stood like ragged beggars along\n",
        "the roadside; cows lean and shaggy and looking pinched up by hunger,\n",
        "were greedily tearing at the grass along the ditches. They looked as\n",
        "though they had just been snatched out of the murderous clutches of\n",
        "some threatening monster; and the piteous state of the weak, starved\n",
        "beasts in the midst of the lovely spring day, called up, like a white\n",
        "phantom, the endless, comfortless winter with its storms, and frosts,\n",
        "and snows.... 'No,' thought Arkady, 'this is not a rich country; it\n",
        "does not impress one by plenty or industry; it can't, it can't go on\n",
        "like this, reforms are absolutely necessary ... but how is one to carry\n",

        "bushes, grass--shone and stirred gently in wide waves under the soft\n",
        "breath of the warm wind; from all sides flooded the endless trilling\n",
        "music of the larks; the peewits were calling as they hovered over the\n",
        "low-lying meadows, or noiselessly ran over the tussocks of grass; the\n",
        "rooks strutted among the half-grown short spring-corn, standing out\n",
        "black against its tender green; they disappeared in the already\n",
        "whitening rye, only from time to time their heads peeped out amid its\n",
        "grey waves. Arkady gazed and gazed, and his reflections grew slowly\n",
        "fainter and passed away.... He flung off his cloak and turned to his\n",
        "father, with a face so bright and boyish, that the latter gave him\n",
        "another hug.\n",
        "\n",

        "together splendidly, Arkasha; you shall help me in farming the estate,\n",

        "Pavel Petrovitch Kirsanov was educated first at home, like his younger\n",
        "brother, and afterwards in the Corps of Pages. From childhood he was\n",
        "distinguished by remarkable beauty; moreover he was self-confident,\n",
        "somewhat ironical, and had a rather biting humour; he could not fail to\n",
        "please. He began to be seen everywhere, directly he had received his\n",
        "commission as an officer. He was much admired in society, and he\n",
        "indulged every whim, even every caprice and every folly, and gave\n",
        "himself airs, but that too was attractive in him. Women went out of\n",
        "their senses over him; men called him a coxcomb, and were secretly\n",
        "jealous of him. He lived, as has been related already, in the same\n",
        "apartments as his brother, whom he loved sincerely, though he was not\n",
        "at all like him. Nikolai Petrovitch was a little lame, he had small,\n",
        "pleasing features of a rather melancholy cast, small, black eyes, and\n",
        "thin, soft hair; he liked being lazy, but he also liked reading, and\n",
        "was timid in society.\n",
        "\n",
        "Pavel Petrovitch did not spend a single evening at home, prided himself\n",
        "on his ease and audacity (he was just bringing gymnastics into fashion\n",
        "among young men in society), and had read in all some five or six\n",
        "French books. At twenty-eight he was already a captain; a brilliant\n",
        "career awaited him. Suddenly everything was changed.\n",
        "\n",
        "At that time, there was sometimes seen in Petersburg society a woman\n",
        "who has even yet not been forgotten. Princess R----. She had a\n",
        "well-educated, well-bred, but rather stupid husband, and no children.\n",
        "She used suddenly to go abroad, and suddenly return to Russia, and led\n",
        "an eccentric life in general. She had the reputation of being a\n",
        "frivolous coquette, abandoned herself eagerly to every sort of\n",
        "pleasure, danced to exhaustion, laughed and jested with young men, whom\n",
        "she received in the dim light of her drawing-room before dinner; while\n",
        "at night she wept and prayed, found no peace in anything, and often\n",
        "paced her room till morning, wringing her hands in anguish, or sat,\n",
        "pale and chill, over a psalter. Day came, and she was transformed again\n",
        "into a grand lady; again she went out, laughed, chattered, and simply\n",
        "flung herself headlong into anything which could afford her the\n",
        "slightest distraction. She was marvellously well-proportioned, her hair\n",
        "coloured like gold and heavy as gold hung below her knees, but no one\n",
        "would have called her a beauty; in her whole face the only good point\n",
        "was her eyes, and even her eyes were not good--they were grey, and not\n",
        "large--but their glance was swift and deep, unconcerned to the point of\n",
        "audacity, and thoughtful to the point of melancholy--an enigmatic\n",
        "glance. There was a light of something extraordinary in them, even\n",
        "while her tongue was lisping the emptiest of inanities. She dressed\n",
        "with elaborate care. Pavel Petrovitch met her at a ball, danced a\n",
        "mazurka with her, in the course of which she did not utter a single\n",
        "rational word, and fell passionately in love with her. Being accustomed\n",
        "to make conquests, in this instance, too, he soon attained his object,\n",
        "but his easy success did not damp his ardour. On the contrary, he was\n",
        "in still more torturing, still closer bondage to this woman, in whom,\n",
        "even at the very moment when she surrendered herself utterly, there\n",
        "seemed always something still mysterious and unattainable, to which\n",
        "none could penetrate. What was hidden in that soul--God knows! It\n",
        "seemed as though she were in the power of mysterious forces,\n",
        "incomprehensible even to herself; they seemed to play on her at will;\n",
        "her intellect was not powerful enough to master their caprices. Her\n",
        "whole behaviour presented a series of inconsistencies; the only letters\n",
        "which could have awakened her husband's just suspicions, she wrote to a\n",
        "man who was almost a stranger to her, whilst her love had always an\n",
        "element of melancholy; with a man she had chosen as a lover, she ceased\n",
        "to laugh and to jest, she listened to him, and gazed at him with a look\n",
        "of bewilderment. Sometimes, for the most part suddenly, this\n",
        "bewilderment passed into chill horror; her face took a wild, death-like\n",
        "expression; she locked herself up in her bedroom, and her maid, putting\n",
        "her ear to the keyhole, could hear her smothered sobs. More than once,\n",
        "as he went home after a tender interview, Kirsanov felt within him that\n",
        "heartrending, bitter vexation which follows on a total failure.\n",
        "\n",
        "'What more do I want?' he asked himself, while his heart was heavy. He\n",
        "once gave her a ring with a sphinx engraved on the stone.\n",
        "\n",
        "'What's that?' she asked; 'a sphinx?'\n",
        "\n",
        "'Yes,' he answered, 'and that sphinx is you.'\n",
        "\n",
        "'I?' she queried, and slowly raising her enigmatical glance upon him.\n",
        "'Do you know that's awfully flattering?' she added with a meaningless\n",
        "smile, while her eyes still kept the same strange look.\n",
        "\n",
        "Pavel Petrovitch suffered even while Princess R---- loved him; but when\n",
        "she grew cold to him, and that happened rather quickly, he almost went\n",
        "out of his mind. He was on the rack, and he was jealous; he gave her no\n",
        "peace, followed her about everywhere; she grew sick of his pursuit of\n",
        "her, and she went abroad. He resigned his commission in spite of the\n",
        "entreaties of his friends and the exhortations of his superiors, and\n",
        "followed the princess; four years he spent in foreign countries, at one\n",
        "time pursuing her, at another time intentionally losing sight of her.\n",
        "He was ashamed of himself, he was disgusted with his own lack of spirit\n",
        "... but nothing availed. Her image, that incomprehensible, almost\n",
        "meaningless, but bewitching image, was deeply rooted in his heart. At\n",
        "Baden he once more regained his old footing with her; it seemed as\n",
        "though she had never loved him so passionately ... but in a month it\n",
        "was all at an end: the flame flickered up for the last time and went\n",
        "out for ever. Foreseeing inevitable separation, he wanted at least to\n",
        "remain her friend, as though friendship with such a woman was\n",
        "possible.... She secretly left Baden, and from that time steadily\n",
        "avoided Kirsanov. He returned to Russia, and tried to live his former\n",
        "life again; but he could not get back into the old groove. He wandered\n",
        "from place to place like a man possessed; he still went into society;\n",
        "he still retained the habits of a man of the world; he could boast of\n",
        "two or three fresh conquests; but he no longer expected anything much\n",
        "of himself or of others, and he undertook nothing. He grew old and\n",
        "grey; spending all his evenings at the club, jaundiced and bored, and\n",
        "arguing in bachelor society became a necessity for him--a bad sign, as\n",
        "we all know. Marriage, of course, he did not even think of. Ten years\n",
        "passed in this way; they passed by colourless and fruitless--and\n",
        "quickly, fearfully quickly. Nowhere does time fly past as in Russia; in\n",
        "prison they say it flies even faster. One day at dinner at the club,\n",
        "Pavel Petrovitch heard of the death of the Princess R----. She had died\n",
        "at Paris in a state bordering on insanity.\n",
        "\n",
        "He got up from the table, and a long time he paced about the rooms of\n",
        "the club, or stood stockstill near the card-players, but he did not go\n",
        "home earlier than usual. Some time later he received a packet addressed\n",
        "to him; in it was the ring he had given the princess. She had drawn\n",
        "lines in the shape of a cross over the sphinx and sent him word that\n",
        "the solution of the enigma--was the cross.\n",
        "\n",
        "This happened at the beginning of the year 1848, at the very time when\n",
        "Nikolai Petrovitch came to Petersburg, after the loss of his wife.\n",
        "Pavel Petrovitch had scarcely seen his brother since the latter had\n",
        "settled in the country; the marriage of Nikolai Petrovitch had\n",
        "coincided with the very first days of Pavel Petrovitch's acquaintance\n",
        "with the princess. When he came back from abroad, he had gone to him\n",
        "with the intention of staying a couple of months with him, in\n",
        "sympathetic enjoyment of his happiness, but he had only succeeded in\n",
        "standing a week of it. The difference in the positions of the two\n",
        "brothers was too great. In 1848, this difference had grown less;\n",
        "Nikolai Petrovitch had lost his wife, Pavel Petrovitch had lost his\n",
        "memories; after the death of the princess he tried not to think of her.\n",
        "But to Nikolai, there remained the sense of a well-spent life, his son\n",
        "was growing up under his eyes; Pavel, on the contrary, a solitary\n",
        "bachelor, was entering upon that indefinite twilight period of regrets\n",
        "that are akin to hopes, and hopes that are akin to regrets, when youth\n",
        "is over, while old age has not yet come.\n",
        "\n",
        "This time was harder for Pavel Petrovitch than for another man; in\n",
        "losing his past, he lost everything.\n",
        "\n",
        "'I will not invite you to Maryino now,' Nikolai Petrovitch said to him\n",
        "one day, (he had called his property by that name in honour of his\n",
        "wife); 'you were dull there in my dear wife's time, and now I think you\n",
        "would be bored to death.'\n",
        "\n",
        "'I was stupid and fidgety then,' answered Pavel Petrovitch; 'since then\n",
        "I have grown quieter, if not wiser. On the contrary, now, if you will\n",
        "let me, I am ready to settle with you for good.'\n",

        "For all answer Nikolai Petrovitch embraced him; but a year and a half\n",
        "passed after this conversation, before Pavel Petrovitch made up his\n",
        "mind to carry out his intention. When he was once settled in the\n",
        "country, however, he did not leave it, even during the three winters\n",
        "which Nikolai Petrovitch spent in Petersburg with his son. He began to\n",
        "read, chiefly English; he arranged his whole life, roughly speaking, in\n",
        "the English style, rarely saw the neighbours, and only went out to the\n",
        "election of marshals, where he was generally silent, only occasionally\n",
        "annoying and alarming land-owners of the old school by his liberal\n",
        "sallies, and not associating with the representatives of the younger\n",
        "generation. Both the latter and the former considered him 'stuck up';\n",
        "and both parties respected him for his fine aristocratic manners; for\n",
        "his reputation for successes in love; for the fact that he was very\n",
        "well dressed and always stayed in the best room in the best hotel; for\n",
        "the fact that he generally dined well, and had once even dined with\n",
        "Wellington at Louis Philippe's table; for the fact that he always took\n",
        "everywhere with him a real silver dressing-case and a portable bath;\n",
        "for the fact that he always smelt of some exceptionally 'good form'\n",
        "scent; for the fact that he played whist in masterly fashion, and\n",
        "always lost; and lastly, they respected him also for his incorruptible\n",

        "\n",
        "'Pardon me, if I disturb you,' began Pavel Petrovitch, not looking at\n",

        "'Certainly,' answered Fenitchka; 'how much do you desire them to buy?'\n",
        "\n",
        "'Oh, half a pound will be enough, I imagine. You have made a change\n",
        "here, I see,' he added, with a rapid glance round him, which glided\n",
        "over Fenitchka's face too. 'The curtains here,' he explained, seeing\n",

        "\n",

        "present of them; but they have been put up a long while now.'\n",
        "\n",
        "'Yes, and it's a long while since I have been to see you. Now it is\n",
        "very nice here.'\n",

        "\n",
        "'You are more comfortable here than in the little lodge you used to\n",

        "\n",
        "Pavel Petrovitch was silent. 'Now he is going,' thought Fenitchka; but\n",
        "he did not go, and she stood before him motionless.\n",
        "\n",
        "'What did you send your little one away for?' said Pavel Petrovitch at\n",
        "last. 'I love children; let me see him.'\n",
        "\n",
        "Fenitchka blushed all over with confusion and delight. She was afraid\n",
        "of Pavel Petrovitch; he had scarcely ever spoken to her.\n",
        "\n",
        "'Dunyasha,' she called; 'will you bring Mitya, please.' (Fenitchka did\n",
        "not treat any one in the house familiarly.) 'But wait a minute, he must\n",
        "have a frock on,' Fenitchka was going towards the door.\n",

        "quickly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Pavel Petrovitch was left alone, and he looked round this time with\n",
        "special attention. The small low-pitched room in which he found himself\n",
        "was very clean and snug. It smelt of the freshly painted floor and of\n",
        "camomile. Along the walls stood chairs with lyre-shaped backs, bought\n",
        "by the late general on his campaign in Poland; in one corner was a\n",
        "little bedstead under a muslin canopy beside an iron-clamped chest with\n",
        "a convex lid. In the opposite corner a little lamp was burning before a\n",
        "big dark picture of St. Nikolai the wonder-worker; a tiny porcelain egg\n",
        "hung by a red ribbon from the protruding gold halo down to the saint's\n",
        "breast; by the windows greenish glass jars of last year's jam carefully\n",
        "tied down could be seen; on their paper covers Fenitchka herself had\n",
        "written in big letters 'Gooseberry'; Nikolai Petrovitch was\n",
        "particularly fond of that preserve. On a long cord from the ceiling a\n",
        "cage hung with a short-tailed siskin in it; he was constantly chirping\n",
        "and hopping about, the cage was constantly shaking and swinging, while\n",
        "hempseeds fell with a light tap on to the floor. On the wall just above\n",
        "a small chest of drawers hung some rather bad photographs of Nikolai\n",
        "Petrovitch in various attitudes, taken by an itinerant photographer;\n",
        "there too hung a photograph of Fenitchka herself, which was an absolute\n",
        "failure; it was an eyeless face wearing a forced smile, in a dingy\n",
        "frame, nothing more could be made out; while above Fenitchka, General\n",
        "Yermolov, in a Circassian cloak, scowled menacingly upon the Caucasian\n",
        "mountains in the distance, from beneath a little silk shoe for pins\n",
        "which fell right on to his brows.\n",
        "\n",
        "Five minutes passed; bustling and whispering could be heard in the next\n",
        "room. Pavel Petrovitch took up from the chest of drawers a greasy book,\n",
        "an odd volume of Masalsky's _Musketeer_, and turned over a few\n",
        "pages.... The door opened, and Fenitchka came in with Mitya in her\n",
        "arms. She had put on him a little red smock with embroidery on the\n",
        "collar, had combed his hair and washed his face; he was breathing\n",
        "heavily, his whole body working, and his little hands waving in the\n",
        "air, as is the way with all healthy babies; but his smart smock\n",
        "obviously impressed him, an expression of delight was reflected in\n",
        "every part of his little fat person. Fenitchka had put her own hair too\n",
        "in order, and had arranged her kerchief; but she might well have\n",
        "remained as she was. And really is there anything in the world more\n",
        "captivating than a beautiful young mother with a healthy baby in her\n",
        "arms?\n",
        "\n",
        "'What a chubby fellow!' said Pavel Petrovitch graciously, and he\n",
        "tickled Mitya's little double chin with the tapering nail of his\n",
        "forefinger. The baby stared at the siskin, and chuckled.\n",
        "\n",
        "'That's uncle,' said Fenitchka, bending her face down to him and\n",
        "slightly rocking him, while Dunyasha quietly set in the window a\n",
        "smouldering perfumed stick, putting a halfpenny under it.\n",
        "\n",
        "'How many months old is he?' asked Pavel Petrovitch.\n",
        "\n",
        "'Six months; it will soon be seven, on the eleventh.'\n",
        "\n",
        "'Isn't it eight, Fedosya Nikolaevna?' put in Dunyasha, with some\n",
        "timidity.\n",
        "\n",
        "'No, seven; what an idea!' The baby chuckled again, stared at the\n",
        "chest, and suddenly caught hold of his mother's nose and mouth with all\n",
        "his five little fingers. 'Saucy mite,' said Fenitchka, not drawing her\n",
        "face away.\n",
        "\n",
        "'He's like my brother,' observed Pavel Petrovitch.\n",
        "\n",
        "'Who else should he be like?' thought Fenitchka.\n",
        "\n",
        "'Yes,' continued Pavel Petrovitch, as though speaking to himself;\n",
        "'there's an unmistakable likeness.' He looked attentively, almost\n",
        "mournfully, at Fenitchka.\n",
        "\n",
        "'That's uncle,' she repeated, in a whisper this time.\n",
        "\n",
        "'Ah! Pavel! so you're here!' was heard suddenly the voice of Nikolai\n",
        "Petrovitch.\n",
        "\n",
        "Pavel Petrovitch turned hurriedly round, frowning; but his brother\n",
        "looked at him with such delight, such gratitude, that he could not help\n",
        "responding to his smile.\n",
        "\n",
        "'You've a splendid little cherub,' he said, and looking at his watch,\n",

        "\n",
        "And, assuming an expression of indifference, Pavel Petrovitch at once\n",
        "went out of the room.\n",
        "\n",
        "'Did he come of himself?' Nikolai Petrovitch asked Fenitchka.\n",
        "\n",
        "'Yes; he knocked and came in.'\n",
        "\n",
        "'Well, and has Arkasha been in to see you again?'\n",
        "\n",
        "'No. Hadn't I better move into the lodge, Nikolai Petrovitch?'\n",
        "\n",

        "'I wonder whether it wouldn't be best just for the first.'\n",
        "\n",
        "'N ... no,' Nikolai Petrovitch brought out hesitatingly, rubbing his\n",
        "forehead. 'We ought to have done it before.... How are you, fatty?' he\n",
        "said, suddenly brightening, and going up to the baby, he kissed him on\n",
        "the cheek; then he bent a little and pressed his lips to Fenitchka's\n",
        "hand, which lay white as milk upon Mitya's little red smock.\n",
        "\n",
        "'Nikolai Petrovitch! what are you doing?' she whispered, dropping her\n",
        "eyes, then slowly raising them. Very charming was the expression of her\n",
        "eyes when she peeped, as it were, from under her lids, and smiled\n",
        "tenderly and a little foolishly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Nikolai Petrovitch had made Fenitchka's acquaintance in the following\n",
        "manner. He had once happened three years before to stay a night at an\n",
        "inn in a remote district town. He was agreeably struck by the cleanness\n",
        "of the room assigned to him, the freshness of the bed-linen. Surely the\n",
        "woman of the house must be a German? was the idea that occurred to him;\n",
        "but she proved to be a Russian, a woman of about fifty, neatly dressed,\n",
        "of a good-looking, sensible countenance and discreet speech. He entered\n",
        "into conversation with her at tea; he liked her very much. Nikolai\n",
        "Petrovitch had at that time only just moved into his new home, and not\n",
        "wishing to keep serfs in the house, he was on the look-out for\n",
        "wage-servants; the woman of the inn on her side complained of the small\n",
        "number of visitors to the town, and the hard times; he proposed to her\n",
        "to come into his house in the capacity of housekeeper; she consented.\n",
        "Her husband had long been dead, leaving her an only daughter,\n",
        "Fenitchka. Within a fortnight Arina Savishna (that was the new\n",
        "housekeeper's name) arrived with her daughter at Maryino and installed\n",
        "herself in the little lodge. Nikolai Petrovitch's choice proved a\n",
        "successful one. Arina brought order into the household. As for\n",
        "Fenitchka, who was at that time seventeen, no one spoke of her, and\n",
        "scarcely any one saw her; she lived quietly and sedately, and only on\n",
        "Sundays Nikolai Petrovitch noticed in the church somewhere in a side\n",
        "place the delicate profile of her white face. More than a year passed\n",
        "thus.\n",
        "\n",
        "One morning, Arina came into his study, and bowing low as usual, she\n",
        "asked him if he could do anything for her daughter, who had got a spark\n",
        "from the stove in her eye. Nikolai Petrovitch, like all stay-at-home\n",
        "people, had studied doctoring and even compiled a homoeopathic guide.\n",
        "He at once told Arina to bring the patient to him. Fenitchka was much\n",
        "frightened when she heard the master had sent for her; however, she\n",
        "followed her mother. Nikolai Petrovitch led her to the window and took\n",
        "her head in his two hands. After thoroughly examining her red and\n",
        "swollen eye, he prescribed a fomentation, which he made up himself at\n",
        "once, and tearing his handkerchief in pieces, he showed her how it\n",
        "ought to be applied. Fenitchka listened to all he had to say, and then\n",
        "was going. 'Kiss the master's hand, silly girl,' said Arina. Nikolai\n",
        "Petrovitch did not give her his hand, and in confusion himself kissed\n",
        "her bent head on the parting of her hair. Fenitchka's eye was soon well\n",
        "again, but the impression she had made on Nikolai Petrovitch did not\n",
        "pass away so quickly. He was for ever haunted by that pure, delicate,\n",
        "timidly raised face; he felt on the palms of his hands that soft hair,\n",
        "and saw those innocent, slightly parted lips, through which pearly\n",
        "teeth gleamed with moist brilliance in the sunshine. He began to watch\n",
        "her with great attention in church, and tried to get into conversation\n",
        "with her. At first she was shy of him, and one day meeting him at the\n",
        "approach of evening in a narrow footpath through a field of rye, she\n",
        "ran into the tall thick rye, overgrown with cornflowers and wormwood,\n",
        "so as not to meet him face to face. He caught sight of her little head\n",
        "through a golden network of ears of rye, from which she was peeping out\n",
        "like a little animal, and called affectionately to her--\n",
        "\n",
        "'Good-evening, Fenitchka! I don't bite.'\n",
        "\n",
        "'Good-evening,' she whispered, not coming out of her ambush.\n",
        "\n",
        "By degrees she began to be more at home with him, but was still shy in\n",
        "his presence, when suddenly her mother, Arina, died of cholera. What\n",
        "was to become of Fenitchka? She inherited from her mother a love for\n",
        "order, regularity, and respectability; but she was so young, so alone.\n",
        "Nikolai Petrovitch was himself so good and considerate.... It's\n",
        "needless to relate the rest....\n",
        "\n",

        "variegated Persian rug nailed to the wall; with walnut furniture,\n",
        "upholstered in dark green velveteen, with a _renaissance_ bookcase of\n",
        "old black oak, with bronze statuettes on the magnificent writing-table,\n",
        "with an open hearth. He threw himself on the sofa, clasped his hands\n",
        "behind his head, and remained without moving, looking with a face\n",
        "almost of despair at the ceiling. Whether he wanted to hide from the\n",
        "very walls that which was reflected in his face, or for some other\n",
        "reason, he got up, drew the heavy window curtains, and again threw\n",

        "The town of X---- to which our friends set off was in the jurisdiction\n",
        "of a governor who was a young man, and at once a progressive and a\n",
        "despot, as often happens with Russians. Before the end of the first\n",
        "year of his government, he had managed to quarrel not only with the\n",
        "marshal of nobility, a retired officer of the guards, who kept open\n",
        "house and a stud of horses, but even with his own subordinates. The\n",
        "feuds arising from this cause assumed at last such proportions that the\n",
        "ministry in Petersburg had found it necessary to send down a trusted\n",
        "personage with a commission to investigate it all on the spot. The\n",
        "choice of the authorities fell upon Matvy Ilyitch Kolyazin, the son of\n",
        "the Kolyazin, under whose protection the brothers Kirsanov had once\n",

        "progressive; and though he was already a bigwig, he was not like the\n",

        "condescendingly, and laughed so good-naturedly, that on a first\n",
        "acquaintance he might even be taken for 'a jolly good fellow.' On\n",
        "important occasions, however, he knew, as the saying is, how to make\n",

        "could turn him round his finger. Matvy Ilyitch used to speak with great\n",

        "had been interested in many things, but nothing had completely\n",
        "satisfied her; indeed, she hardly desired complete satisfaction. Her\n",
        "intellect was at the same time inquiring and indifferent; her doubts\n",
        "were never soothed to forgetfulness, and they never grew strong enough\n",
        "to distract her. Had she not been rich and independent, she would\n",
        "perhaps have thrown herself into the struggle, and have known passion.\n",
        "But life was easy for her, though she was bored at times, and she went\n",
        "on passing day after day with deliberation, never in a hurry, placid,\n",
        "and only rarely disturbed. Dreams sometimes danced in rainbow colours\n",
        "before her eyes even, but she breathed more freely when they died away,\n",
        "and did not regret them. Her imagination indeed overstepped the limits\n",
        "of what is reckoned permissible by conventional morality; but even then\n",
        "her blood flowed as quietly as ever in her fascinatingly graceful,\n",
        "tranquil body. Sometimes coming out of her fragrant bath all warm and\n",
        "enervated, she would fall to musing on the nothingness of life, the\n",

        "thought, and his heart again knew the sweetness of magnanimous\n",
        "emotions. Katya vaguely realised that he was seeking a sort of\n",
        "consolation in her company, and did not deny him or herself the\n",
        "innocent pleasure of a half-shy, half-confidential friendship. They did\n",
        "not talk to each other in Anna Sergyevna's presence; Katya always\n",
        "shrank into herself under her sister's sharp eyes; while Arkady, as\n",
        "befits a man in love, could pay attention to nothing else when near the\n",
        "object of his passion; but he was happy with Katya alone. He was\n",
        "conscious that he did not possess the power to interest Madame\n",
        "Odintsov; he was shy and at a loss when he was left alone with her, and\n",
        "she did not know what to say to him, he was too young for her. With\n",
        "Katya, on the other hand, Arkady felt at home; he treated her\n",
        "condescendingly, encouraged her to express the impressions made on her\n",
        "by music, reading novels, verses, and other such trifles, without\n",
        "noticing or realising that these trifles were what interested him too.\n",
        "Katya, on her side, did not try to drive away melancholy. Arkady was at\n",
        "his ease with Katya, Madame Odintsov with Bazarov, and thus it usually\n",
        "came to pass that the two couples, after being a little while together,\n",
        "went off on their separate ways, especially during the walks. Katya\n",
        "adored nature, and Arkady loved it, though he did not dare to\n",
        "acknowledge it; Madame Odintsov was, like Bazarov, rather indifferent\n",
        "to the beauties of nature. The almost continual separation of the two\n",
        "friends was not without its consequences; the relations between them\n",
        "began to change. Bazarov gave up talking to Arkady about Madame\n",
        "Odintsov, gave up even abusing her 'aristocratic ways'; Katya, it is\n",
        "true, he praised as before, and only advised him to restrain her\n",
        "sentimental tendencies, but his praises were hurried, his advice dry,\n",
        "and in general he talked less to Arkady than before ... he seemed to\n",
        "avoid him, seemed ill at ease with him.\n",
        "\n",
        "Arkady observed it all, but he kept his observations to himself.\n",
        "\n",
        "The real cause of all this 'newness' was the feeling inspired in\n",
        "Bazarov by Madame Odintsov, a feeling which tortured and maddened him,\n",
        "and which he would at once have denied, with scornful laughter and\n",
        "cynical abuse, if any one had ever so remotely hinted at the\n",
        "possibility of what was taking place in him. Bazarov had a great love\n",
        "for women and for feminine beauty; but love in the ideal, or, as he\n",
        "expressed it, romantic sense, he called lunacy, unpardonable\n",
        "imbecility; he regarded chivalrous sentiments as something of the\n",
        "nature of deformity or disease, and had more than once expressed his\n",
        "wonder that Toggenburg and all the minnesingers and troubadours had not\n",
        "been put into a lunatic asylum. 'If a woman takes your fancy,' he used\n",
        "to say, 'try and gain your end; but if you can't--well, turn your back\n",
        "on her--there are lots of good fish in the sea.' Madame Odintsov had\n",
        "taken his fancy; the rumours about her, the freedom and independence of\n",
        "her ideas, her unmistakable liking for him, all seemed to be in his\n",
        "favour, but he soon saw that with her he would not 'gain his ends,' and\n",
        "to turn his back on her he found, to his own bewilderment, beyond his\n",
        "power. His blood was on fire directly if he merely thought of her; he\n",
        "could easily have mastered his blood, but something else was taking\n",
        "root in him, something he had never admitted, at which he had always\n",
        "jeered, at which all his pride revolted. In his conversations with Anna\n",
        "Sergyevna he expressed more strongly than ever his calm contempt for\n",
        "everything idealistic; but when he was alone, with indignation he\n",
        "recognised idealism in himself. Then he would set off to the forest and\n",
        "walk with long strides about it, smashing the twigs that came in his\n",
        "way, and cursing under his breath both her and himself; or he would get\n",
        "into the hay-loft in the barn, and, obstinately closing his eyes, try\n",
        "to force himself to sleep, in which, of course, he did not always\n",
        "succeed. Suddenly his fancy would bring before him those chaste hands\n",
        "twining one day about his neck, those proud lips responding to his\n",
        "kisses, those intellectual eyes dwelling with tenderness--yes, with\n",
        "tenderness--on his, and his head went round, and he forgot himself for\n",
        "an instant, till indignation boiled up in him again. He caught himself\n",
        "in all sorts of 'shameful' thoughts, as though he were driven on by a\n",
        "devil mocking him. Sometimes he fancied that there was a change taking\n",
        "place in Madame Odintsov too; that there were signs in the expression\n",
        "of her face of something special; that, perhaps ... but at that point\n",
        "he would stamp, or grind his teeth, and clench his fists.\n",
        "\n",
        "Meanwhile Bazarov was not altogether mistaken. He had struck Madame\n",
        "Odintsov's imagination; he interested her, she thought a great deal\n",
        "about him. In his absence, she was not dull, she was not impatient for\n",
        "his coming, but she always grew more lively on his appearance; she\n",
        "liked to be left alone with him, and she liked talking to him, even\n",
        "when he irritated her or offended her taste, her refined habits. She\n",
        "was, as it were, eager at once to sound him and to analyse herself.\n",
        "\n",
        "One day walking in the garden with her, he suddenly announced, in a\n",
        "surly voice, that he intended going to his father's place very soon....\n",
        "She turned white, as though something had given her a pang, and such a\n",
        "pang, that she wondered and pondered long after, what could be the\n",
        "meaning of it. Bazarov had spoken of his departure with no idea of\n",
        "putting her to the test, of seeing what would come of it; he never\n",
        "'fabricated.' On the morning of that day he had an interview with his\n",
        "father's bailiff, who had taken care of him when he was a child,\n",
        "Timofeitch. This Timofeitch, a little old man of much experience and\n",
        "astuteness, with faded yellow hair, a weather-beaten red face, and tiny\n",
        "tear-drops in his shrunken eyes, unexpectedly appeared before Bazarov,\n",
        "in his shortish overcoat of stout greyish-blue cloth, girt with a strip\n",
        "of leather, and in tarred boots.\n",
        "\n",
        "'Hullo, old man; how are you?' cried Bazarov.\n",
        "\n",
        "'How do you do, Yevgeny Vassilyitch?' began the little old man, and he\n",
        "smiled with delight, so that his whole face was all at once covered\n",
        "with wrinkles.\n",
        "\n",
        "'What have you come for? They sent for me, eh?'\n",
        "\n",
        "'Upon my word, sir, how could we?' mumbled Timofeitch. (He remembered\n",
        "the strict injunctions he had received from his master on starting.)\n",
        "'We were sent to the town on business, and we'd heard news of your\n",
        "honour, so here we turned off on our way, that's to say--to have a look\n",
        "at your honour ... as if we could think of disturbing you!'\n",
        "\n",
        "'Come, don't tell lies!' Bazarov cut him short. 'Is this the road to\n",
        "the town, do you mean to tell me?' Timofeitch hesitated, and made no\n",
        "answer. 'Is my father well?'\n",
        "\n",
        "'Thank God, yes.'\n",
        "\n",

        "both hands, clambered into a wretched-looking racing droshky, and went\n",
        "off at a trot, but not in the direction of the town.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the evening of the same day, Madame Odintsov was sitting in her own\n",

        "Sergyevna even presented him to her aunt and her sister, he soon\n",
        "recovered himself and began to chatter volubly. The introduction of the\n",
        "commonplace is often an advantage in life; it relieves over-strained\n",
        "tension, and sobers too self-confident or self-sacrificing emotions by\n",
        "recalling its close kinship with them. With Sitnikov's appearance\n",

        "indispensable to us. I--do you understand? I need dolts like him. It's\n",
        "not for the gods to bake bricks, in fact!'...\n",
        "\n",

        "took his seat beside Bazarov, and bowing politely to his former\n",
        "fellow-traveller, he called, 'Whip up!' The coach rolled away, and was\n",
        "soon out of sight.... Sitnikov, utterly confused, looked at his\n",
        "coachman, but the latter was flicking his whip about the tail of the\n",
        "off horse. Then Sitnikov jumped into the carriage, and growling at two\n",
        "passing peasants, 'Put on your caps, idiots!' he drove to the town,\n",

        "He had not slept all the previous night, and had not smoked, and had\n",
        "eaten scarcely anything for several days. His profile, already thinner,\n",

        "eat ten times a day, she's quite upset. My father's all right, he's\n",
        "known all sorts of ups and downs himself. No, I can't smoke,' he added,\n",

        "\n",
        "'Yes, yes,' began Bazarov; 'it's a lesson to you, my young friend, an\n",

        "thread, the abyss may open under his feet any minute, and yet he must\n",

        "'romanticism,' but he checked himself, and said, 'rubbish. You don't\n",
        "believe me now, but I tell you; you and I have been in feminine\n",
        "society, and very nice we found it; but to throw up society like that\n",
        "is for all the world like a dip in cold water on a hot day. A man\n",

        "in with him in a blue full-skirted coat with ragged elbows and a pair\n",

        "coat cut him under the armpits, blinking, clearing his throat, and\n",
        "gesticulating with his fingers, while his son was distinguished by a\n",

        "\n",
        "'Humble-pie!' repeated Vassily Ivanovitch. 'You must not imagine,\n",
        "Yevgeny, I want to appeal, so to speak, to our guest's sympathies by\n",
        "making out we live in such a wilderness. Quite the contrary, I maintain\n",

        "inconsiderable for me, I have put my peasants on the rent-system and\n",

        "smouldering ash was still left. 'Well, perhaps, perhaps--I am not going\n",
        "to dispute. What am I? A retired army-doctor, _volla-too_; now fate has\n",
        "made me take to farming. I served in your grandfather's brigade,' he\n",
        "addressed himself again to Arkady; 'yes, yes, I have seen many sights\n",

        "Vassily Ivanovitch brightened up. 'And you must see what a little\n",

        "raspberries, and all kinds of medicinal herbs. However clever you young\n",
        "gentlemen may be, old Paracelsus spoke the holy truth: _in herbis\n",

        "no doctors here at all. There's one of the neighbours here, a retired\n",
        "major, only fancy, he doctors the people too. I asked the question,\n",

        "\n",
        "The old man was alone in his laughter; Arkady forced a smile on his\n",

        "for about an hour; Arkady had time to go to his room, which turned out\n",
        "to be the anteroom attached to the bathroom, but was very snug and\n",

        "\n",
        "Vassily Ivanovitch was the first to get up. 'Come, gentlemen. You must\n",

        "will give you more satisfaction.'\n",
        "\n",
        "The dinner, though prepared in haste, turned out to be very good, even\n",
        "abundant; only the wine was not quite up to the mark; it was almost\n",
        "black sherry, bought by Timofeitch in the town at a well-known\n",
        "merchant's, and had a faint coppery, resinous taste, and the flies were\n",
        "a great nuisance. On ordinary days a serf-boy used to keep driving them\n",
        "away with a large green branch; but on this occasion Vassily Ivanovitch\n",
        "had sent him away through dread of the criticism of the younger\n",
        "generation. Arina Vlasyevna had had time to dress: she had put on a\n",
        "high cap with silk ribbons and a pale blue flowered shawl. She broke\n",
        "down again directly she caught sight of her Enyusha, but her husband\n",
        "had no need to admonish her; she made haste to wipe away her tears\n",
        "herself, for fear of spotting her shawl. Only the young men ate\n",
        "anything; the master and mistress of the house had dined long ago.\n",
        "Fedka waited at table, obviously encumbered by having boots on for the\n",
        "first time; he was assisted by a woman of a masculine cast of face and\n",
        "one eye, by name Anfisushka, who performed the duties of housekeeper,\n",
        "poultry-woman, and laundress. Vassily Ivanovitch walked up and down\n",
        "during the whole of dinner, and with a perfectly happy, positively\n",
        "beatific countenance, talked about the serious anxiety he felt at\n",
        "Napoleon's policy, and the intricacy of the Italian question. Arina\n",
        "Vlasyevna took no notice of Arkady. She did not press him to eat;\n",
        "leaning her round face, to which the full cherry-coloured lips and the\n",
        "little moles on the cheeks and over the eyebrows gave a very simple\n",
        "good-natured expression, on her little closed fist, she did not take\n",
        "her eyes off her son, and kept constantly sighing; she was dying to\n",
        "know for how long he had come, but she was afraid to ask him.\n",
        "\n",
        "'What if he says for two days,' she thought, and her heart sank. After\n",
        "the roast Vassily Ivanovitch disappeared for an instant, and returned\n",
        "with an opened half-bottle of champagne. 'Here,' he cried, 'though we\n",
        "do live in the wilds, we have something to make merry with on festive\n",
        "occasions!' He filled three champagne glasses and a little wineglass,\n",
        "proposed the health of 'our inestimable guests,' and at once tossed off\n",
        "his glass in military fashion; while he made Arina Vlasyevna drink her\n",
        "wineglass to the last drop. When the time came in due course for\n",
        "preserves, Arkady, who could not bear anything sweet, thought it his\n",

        "made, all the more as Bazarov flatly refused them and began at once\n",
        "smoking a cigarette. Then tea came on the scene with cream, butter, and\n",
        "cracknels; then Vassily Ivanovitch took them all into the garden to\n",
        "admire the beauty of the evening. As they passed a garden seat he\n",
        "whispered to Arkady--\n",
        "\n",
        "'At this spot I love to meditate, as I watch the sunset; it suits a\n",
        "recluse like me. And there, a little farther off, I have planted some\n",
        "of the trees beloved of Horace.'\n",
        "\n",
        "'What trees?' asked Bazarov, overhearing.\n",
        "\n",
        "'Oh ... acacias.'\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "'That is, it's time for bed,' Bazarov put in. 'That's a correct idea.\n",
        "It is time, certainly.'\n",
        "\n",
        "As he said good-night to his mother, he kissed her on the forehead,\n",
        "while she embraced him, and stealthily behind his back she gave him her\n",
        "blessing three times. Vassily Ivanovitch conducted Arkady to his room,\n",
        "and wished him 'as refreshing repose as I enjoyed at your happy years.'\n",
        "And Arkady did as a fact sleep excellently in his bath-house; there was\n",
        "a smell of mint in it, and two crickets behind the stove rivalled each\n",
        "other in their drowsy chirping. Vassily Ivanovitch went from Arkady's\n",
        "room to his study, and perching on the sofa at his son's feet, he was\n",
        "looking forward to having a chat with him; but Bazarov at once sent him\n",
        "away, saying he was sleepy, and did not fall asleep till morning. With\n",
        "wide open eyes he stared vindictively into the darkness; the memories\n",
        "of childhood had no power over him; and besides, he had not yet had\n",
        "time to get rid of the impression of his recent bitter emotions. Arina\n",
        "Vlasyevna first prayed to her heart's content, then she had a long,\n",
        "long conversation with Anfisushka, who stood stock-still before her\n",

        "mysterious whisper all her observations and conjectures in regard to\n",
        "Yevgeny Vassilyevitch. The old lady's head was giddy with happiness and\n",
        "wine and tobacco smoke; her husband tried to talk to her, but with a\n",
        "wave of his hand gave it up in despair.\n",
        "\n",
        "Arina Vlasyevna was a genuine Russian gentlewoman of the olden times;\n",
        "she ought to have lived two centuries before, in the old Moscow days.\n",
        "She was very devout and emotional; she believed in fortune-telling,\n",
        "charms, dreams, and omens of every possible kind; she believed in the\n",
        "prophecies of crazy people, in house-spirits, in wood-spirits, in\n",
        "unlucky meetings, in the evil eye, in popular remedies, she ate\n",
        "specially prepared salt on Holy Thursday, and believed that the end of\n",
        "the world was at hand; she believed that if on Easter Sunday the lights\n",
        "did not go out at vespers, then there would be a good crop of\n",
        "buckwheat, and that a mushroom will not grow after it has been looked\n",
        "on by the eye of man; she believed that the devil likes to be where\n",
        "there is water, and that every Jew has a blood-stained patch on his\n",
        "breast; she was afraid of mice, of snakes, of frogs, of sparrows, of\n",
        "leeches, of thunder, of cold water, of draughts, of horses, of goats,\n",
        "of red-haired people, and black cats, and she regarded crickets and\n",
        "dogs as unclean beasts; she never ate veal, doves, crayfishes, cheese,\n",
        "asparagus, artichokes, hares, nor water-melons, because a cut\n",
        "water-melon suggested the head of John the Baptist, and of oysters she\n",
        "could not speak without a shudder; she was fond of eating--and fasted\n",
        "rigidly; she slept ten hours out of the twenty-four--and never went to\n",
        "bed at all if Vassily Ivanovitch had so much as a headache; she had\n",
        "never read a single book except _Alexis or the Cottage in the Forest_;\n",
        "she wrote one, or at the most two letters in a year, but was great in\n",

        "never touched a thing, and was generally disinclined to move from her\n",
        "place. Arina Vlasyevna was very kindhearted, and in her way not at all\n",
        "stupid. She knew that the world is divided into masters whose duty it\n",
        "is to command, and simple folk whose duty it is to serve them--and so\n",
        "she felt no repugnance to servility and prostrations to the ground; but\n",

        "and, so far as could be judged from the deliberation of her gestures\n",

        "Talk, questions followed; Arkady talked most, especially at supper,\n",
        "which was prolonged long after midnight. Nikolai Petrovitch ordered up\n",
        "some bottles of porter which had only just been sent from Moscow, and\n",
        "partook of the festive beverage till his cheeks were crimson, and he\n",
        "kept laughing in a half-childish, half-nervous little chuckle. Even the\n",
        "servants were infected by the general gaiety. Dunyasha ran up and down\n",
        "like one possessed, and was continually slamming doors; while Piotr\n",
        "was, at three o'clock in the morning, still attempting to strum a\n",
        "Cossack waltz on the guitar. The strings gave forth a sweet and\n",

        "troubles with the hired labourers had become insupportable. Some asked\n",
        "for their wages to be settled, or for an increase of wages, while\n",
        "others made off with the wages they had received in advance; the horses\n",
        "fell sick; the harness fell to pieces as though it were burnt; the work\n",
        "was carelessly done; a threshing machine that had been ordered from\n",
        "Moscow turned out to be useless from its great weight, another was\n",
        "ruined the first time it was used; half the cattle sheds were burnt\n",

        "a burning brand to fumigate her cow ... the old woman, it is true,\n",
        "maintained that the whole mischief could be traced to the master's plan\n",
        "of introducing newfangled cheeses and milk-products. The overseer\n",
        "suddenly turned lazy, and began to grow fat, as every Russian grows fat\n",
        "when he gets a snug berth. When he caught sight of Nikolai Petrovitch\n",
        "in the distance, he would fling a stick at a passing pig, or threaten a\n",
        "half-naked urchin, to show his zeal, but the rest of the time he was\n",
        "generally asleep. The peasants who had been put on the rent system did\n",
        "not bring their money at the time due, and stole the forest-timber;\n",
        "almost every night the keepers caught peasants' horses in the meadows\n",
        "of the 'farm,' and sometimes forcibly bore them off. Nikolai Petrovitch\n",
        "would fix a money fine for damages, but the matter usually ended after\n",
        "the horses had been kept a day or two on the master's forage by their\n",
        "returning to their owners. To crown all, the peasants began quarrelling\n",
        "among themselves; brothers asked for a division of property, their\n",
        "wives could not get on together in one house; all of a sudden the\n",
        "squabble, as though at a given signal, came to a head, and at once the\n",
        "whole village came running to the counting-house steps, crawling to the\n",
        "master often drunken and with battered face, demanding justice and\n",
        "judgment; then arose an uproar and clamour, the shrill wailing of the\n",
        "women mixed with the curses of the men. Then one had to examine the\n",
        "contending parties, and shout oneself hoarse, knowing all the while\n",
        "that one could never anyway arrive at a just decision.... There were\n",
        "not hands enough for the harvest; a neighbouring small owner, with the\n",
        "most benevolent countenance, contracted to supply him with reapers for\n",
        "a commission of two roubles an acre, and cheated him in the most\n",
        "shameless fashion; his peasant women demanded unheard-of sums, and the\n",
        "corn meanwhile went to waste; and here they were not getting on with\n",
        "the mowing, and there the Council of Guardians threatened and demanded\n",
        "prompt payment, in full, of interest due....\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "'_Du calme_, _du calme_,' Pavel Petrovitch would remark upon this, but\n",

        "moustache.\n",
        "\n",
        "Bazarov held aloof from these matters, and indeed as a guest it was not\n",
        "for him to meddle in other people's business. The day after his arrival\n",
        "at Maryino, he set to work on his frogs, his infusoria, and his\n",
        "chemical experiments, and was for ever busy with them. Arkady, on the\n",
        "contrary, thought it his duty, if not to help his father, at least to\n",
        "make a show of being ready to help him. He gave him a patient hearing,\n",
        "and once offered him some advice, not with any idea of its being acted\n",
        "upon, but to show his interest. Farming details did not arouse any\n",
        "aversion in him; he used even to dream with pleasure of work on the\n",
        "land, but at this time his brain was swarming with other ideas. Arkady,\n",
        "to his own astonishment, thought incessantly of Nikolskoe; in former\n",
        "days he would simply have shrugged his shoulders if any one had told\n",
        "him that he could ever feel dull under the same roof as Bazarov--and\n",
        "that roof his father's! but he actually was dull and longed to get\n",
        "away. He tried going long walks till he was tired, but that was no use.\n",
        "In conversation with his father one day, he found out that Nikolai\n",
        "Petrovitch had in his possession rather interesting letters, written by\n",
        "Madame Odintsov's mother to his wife, and he gave him no rest till he\n",
        "got hold of the letters, for which Nikolai Petrovitch had to rummage in\n",
        "twenty drawers and boxes. Having gained possession of these\n",
        "half-crumbling papers, Arkady felt, as it were, soothed, just as though\n",
        "he had caught a glimpse of the goal towards which he ought now to go.\n",
        "'I mean that for both of you,' he was constantly whispering--she had\n",
        "added that herself! 'I'll go, I'll go, hang it all!' But he recalled\n",
        "the last visit, the cold reception, and his former embarrassment, and\n",
        "timidity got the better of him. The 'go-ahead' feeling of youth, the\n",
        "secret desire to try his luck, to prove his powers in solitude, without\n",
        "the protection of any one whatever, gained the day at last. Before ten\n",
        "days had passed after his return to Maryino, on the pretext of studying\n",
        "the working of the Sunday schools, he galloped off to the town again,\n",
        "and from there to Nikolskoe. Urging the driver on without intermission,\n",
        "he flew along, like a young officer riding to battle; and he felt both\n",
        "frightened and light-hearted, and was breathless with impatience. 'The\n",
        "great thing is--one mustn't think,' he kept repeating to himself. His\n",
        "driver happened to be a lad of spirit; he halted before every public\n",
        "house, saying, 'A drink or not a drink?' but, to make up for it, when\n",
        "he had drunk he did not spare his horses. At last the lofty roof of the\n",
        "familiar house came in sight.... 'What am I to do?' flashed through\n",
        "Arkady's head. 'Well, there's no turning back now!' The three horses\n",
        "galloped in unison; the driver whooped and whistled at them. And now\n",
        "the bridge was groaning under the hoofs and wheels, and now the avenue\n",
        "of lopped pines seemed running to meet them.... There was a glimpse of\n",
        "a woman's pink dress against the dark green, a young face from under\n",
        "the light fringe of a parasol.... He recognised Katya, and she\n",
        "recognised him. Arkady told the driver to stop the galloping horses,\n",
        "leaped out of the carriage, and went up to her. 'It's you!' she cried,\n",
        "gradually flushing all over; 'let us go to my sister, she's here in the\n",
        "garden; she will be pleased to see you.'\n",
        "\n",
        "Katya led Arkady into the garden. His meeting with her struck him as a\n",
        "particularly happy omen; he was delighted to see her, as though she\n",
        "were of his own kindred. Everything had happened so splendidly; no\n",
        "steward, no formal announcement. At a turn in the path he caught sight\n",
        "of Anna Sergyevna. She was standing with her back to him. Hearing\n",

        "\n",
        "Arkady felt confused again, but the first words she uttered soothed him\n",
        "at once. 'Welcome back, runaway!' she said in her even, caressing\n",

        "wind out of her eyes. 'Where did you pick him up, Katya?'\n",

        "understand that he was not in the least deceived as to the real object\n",
        "of his journey, Bazarov shut himself up in complete solitude; he was\n",
        "overtaken by a fever for work. He did not dispute now with Pavel\n",
        "Petrovitch, especially as the latter assumed an excessively\n",
        "aristocratic demeanour in his presence, and expressed his opinions more\n",
        "in inarticulate sounds than in words. Only on one occasion Pavel\n",
        "Petrovitch fell into a controversy with the _nihilist_ on the subject\n",
        "of the question then much discussed of the rights of the nobles of the\n",

        "with chilly politeness, 'However, we cannot understand one another; I,\n",
        "at least, have not the honour of understanding you.'\n",
        "\n",
        "'I should think not!' cried Bazarov. 'A man's capable of understanding\n",

        "how any other man can blow his nose differently from him, that he's\n",

        "\n",
        "'What, is that an epigram?' observed Pavel Petrovitch inquiringly, and\n",
        "he walked away.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, he sometimes asked permission to be present at Bazarov's\n",
        "experiments, and once even placed his perfumed face, washed with the\n",
        "very best soap, near the microscope to see how a transparent infusoria\n",
        "swallowed a green speck, and busily munched it with two very rapid sort\n",
        "of clappers which were in its throat. Nikolai Petrovitch visited\n",
        "Bazarov much oftener than his brother; he would have come every day, as\n",
        "he expressed it, to 'study,' if his worries on the farm had not taken\n",
        "off his attention. He did not hinder the young man in his scientific\n",
        "researches; he used to sit down somewhere in a corner of the room and\n",
        "look on attentively, occasionally permitting himself a discreet\n",
        "question. During dinner and supper-time he used to try to turn the\n",
        "conversation upon physics, geology, or chemistry, seeing that all other\n",
        "topics, even agriculture, to say nothing of politics, might lead, if\n",
        "not to collisions, at least to mutual unpleasantness. Nikolai\n",
        "Petrovitch surmised that his brother's dislike for Bazarov was no less.\n",
        "An unimportant incident, among many others, confirmed his surmises. The\n",
        "cholera began to make its appearance in some places in the\n",
        "neighbourhood, and even 'carried off' two persons from Maryino itself.\n",
        "In the night Pavel Petrovitch happened to have rather severe symptoms.\n",
        "He was in pain till the morning, but did not have recourse to Bazarov's\n",
        "skill. And when he met him the following day, in reply to his question,\n",
        "'Why he had not sent for him?' answered, still quite pale, but\n",
        "scrupulously brushed and shaved, 'Why, I seem to recollect you said\n",
        "yourself you didn't believe in medicine.' So the days went by. Bazarov\n",
        "went on obstinately and grimly working ... and meanwhile there was in\n",
        "Nikolai Petrovitch's house one creature to whom, if he did not open his\n",
        "heart, he at least was glad to talk.... That creature was Fenitchka.\n",
        "\n",
        "He used to meet her for the most part early in the morning, in the\n",
        "garden, or the farmyard; he never used to go to her room to see her,\n",
        "and she had only once been to his door to inquire--ought she to let\n",
        "Mitya have his bath or not? It was not only that she confided in him,\n",
        "that she was not afraid of him--she was positively freer and more at\n",
        "her ease in her behaviour with him than with Nikolai Petrovitch\n",
        "himself. It is hard to say how it came about; perhaps it was because\n",
        "she unconsciously felt the absence in Bazarov of all gentility, of all\n",
        "that superiority which at once attracts and overawes. In her eyes he\n",
        "was both an excellent doctor and a simple man. She looked after her\n",
        "baby without constraint in his presence; and once when she was suddenly\n",
        "attacked with giddiness and headache--she took a spoonful of medicine\n",
        "from his hand. Before Nikolai Petrovitch she kept, as it were, at a\n",
        "distance from Bazarov; she acted in this way not from hypocrisy, but\n",
        "from a kind of feeling of propriety. Pavel Petrovitch she was more\n",
        "afraid of than ever; for some time he had begun to watch her, and would\n",
        "suddenly make his appearance, as though he sprang out of the earth\n",
        "behind her back, in his English suit, with his immovable vigilant face,\n",
        "and his hands in his pockets. 'It's like a bucket of cold water on\n",
        "one,' Fenitchka complained to Dunyasha, and the latter sighed in\n",
        "response, and thought of another 'heartless' man. Bazarov, without the\n",
        "least suspicion of the fact, had become the _cruel tyrant_ of her\n",
        "heart.\n",
        "\n",
        "Fenitchka liked Bazarov; but he liked her too. His face was positively\n",
        "transformed when he talked to her; it took a bright, almost kind\n",
        "expression, and his habitual nonchalance was replaced by a sort of\n",
        "jesting attentiveness. Fenitchka was growing prettier every day. There\n",
        "is a time in the life of young women when they suddenly begin to expand\n",
        "and blossom like summer roses; this time had come for Fenitchka.\n",
        "Dressed in a delicate white dress, she seemed herself slighter and\n",
        "whiter; she was not tanned by the sun; but the heat, from which she\n",
        "could not shield herself, spread a slight flush over her cheeks and\n",
        "ears, and, shedding a soft indolence over her whole body, was reflected\n",
        "in a dreamy languor in her pretty eyes. She was almost unable to work;\n",

        "went back to his microscope, but his heart was beating, and the\n",
        "composure necessary for taking observations had disappeared. 'He caught\n",
        "sight of us to-day,' he thought; 'but would he really act like this on\n",
        "his brother's account? And what a mighty matter is it--a kiss? There\n",
        "must be something else in it. Bah! isn't he perhaps in love with her\n",
        "himself? To be sure, he's in love; it's as clear as day. What a\n",
        "complication! It's a nuisance!' he decided at last; 'it's a bad job,\n",
        "look at it which way you will. In the first place, to risk a bullet\n",
        "through one's brains, and in any case to go away; and then Arkady ...\n",
        "and that dear innocent pussy, Nikolai Petrovitch. It's a bad job, an\n",
        "awfully bad job.'\n",
        "\n",
        "The day passed in a kind of peculiar stillness and languor. Fenitchka\n",
        "gave no sign of her existence; she sat in her little room like a mouse\n",
        "in its hole. Nikolai Petrovitch had a careworn air. He had just heard\n",
        "that blight had begun to appear in his wheat, upon which he had in\n",
        "particular rested his hopes. Pavel Petrovitch overwhelmed every one,\n",
        "even Prokofitch, with his icy courtesy. Bazarov began a letter to his\n",
        "father, but tore it up, and threw it under the table.\n",
        "\n",
        "'If I die,' he thought, 'they will find it out; but I'm not going to\n",
        "die. No, I shall struggle along in this world a good while yet.' He\n",
        "gave Piotr orders to come to him on important business the next morning\n",
        "directly it was light. Piotr imagined that he wanted to take him to\n",
        "Petersburg with him. Bazarov went late to bed, and all night long he\n",
        "was harassed by disordered dreams.... Madame Odintsov kept appearing in\n",
        "them, now she was his mother, and she was followed by a kitten with\n",
        "black whiskers, and this kitten seemed to be Fenitchka; then Pavel\n",
        "Petrovitch took the shape of a great wood, with which he had yet to\n",
        "fight. Piotr waked him up at four o'clock; he dressed at once, and went\n",
        "out with him.\n",
        "\n",
        "It was a lovely, fresh morning; tiny flecked clouds hovered overhead in\n",
        "little curls of foam on the pale clear blue; a fine dew lay in drops on\n",
        "the leaves and grass, and sparkled like silver on the spiders' webs;\n",
        "the damp, dark earth seemed still to keep traces of the rosy dawn; from\n",
        "the whole sky the songs of larks came pouring in showers. Bazarov\n",
        "walked as far as the copse, sat down in the shade at its edge, and only\n",
        "then disclosed to Piotr the nature of the service he expected of him.\n",
        "The refined valet was mortally alarmed; but Bazarov soothed him by the\n",
        "assurance that he would have nothing to do but stand at a distance and\n",
        "look on, and that he would not incur any sort of responsibility. 'And\n",
        "meantime,' he added, 'only think what an important part you have to\n",
        "play!' Piotr threw up his hands, looked down, and leaned against a\n",
        "birch-tree, looking green with terror.\n",
        "\n",
        "The road from Maryino skirted the copse; a light dust lay on it,\n",
        "untouched by wheel or foot since the previous day. Bazarov\n",
        "unconsciously stared along this road, picked and gnawed a blade of\n",
        "grass, while he kept repeating to himself, 'What a piece of foolery!'\n",
        "The chill of the early morning made him shiver twice.... Piotr looked\n",
        "at him dejectedly, but Bazarov only smiled; he was not afraid.\n",
        "\n",
        "The tramp of horses' hoofs was heard along the road.... A peasant came\n",
        "into sight from behind the trees. He was driving before him two horses\n",
        "hobbled together, and as he passed Bazarov he looked at him rather\n",
        "strangely, without touching his cap, which it was easy to see disturbed\n",
        "Piotr, as an unlucky omen. 'There's some one else up early too,'\n",
        "thought Bazarov; 'but he at least has got up for work, while we ...'\n",
        "\n",
        "'Fancy the gentleman's coming,' Piotr faltered suddenly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Bazarov raised his head and saw Pavel Petrovitch. Dressed in a light\n",
        "check jacket and snow-white trousers, he was walking rapidly along the\n",
        "road; under his arm he carried a box wrapped up in green cloth.\n",
        "\n",
        "'I beg your pardon, I believe I have kept you waiting,' he observed,\n",
        "bowing first to Bazarov, then to Piotr, whom he treated respectfully at\n",
        "that instant, as representing something in the nature of a second. 'I\n",
        "was unwilling to wake my man.'\n",
        "\n",
        "'It doesn't matter,' answered Bazarov; 'we've only just arrived\n",
        "ourselves.'\n",
        "\n",
        "'Ah! so much the better!' Pavel Petrovitch took a look round. 'There's\n",
        "no one in sight; no one hinders us. We can proceed?'\n",
        "\n",
        "'Let us proceed.'\n",
        "\n",
        "'You do not, I presume, desire any fresh explanations?'\n",
        "\n",
        "'No, I don't.'\n",
        "\n",
        "'Would you like to load?' inquired Pavel Petrovitch, taking the pistols\n",
        "out of the box.\n",
        "\n",
        "'No; you load, and I will measure out the paces. My legs are longer,'\n",
        "added Bazarov with a smile. 'One, two, three.'\n",
        "\n",
        "'Yevgeny Vassilyevitch,' Piotr faltered with an effort (he shaking as\n",
        "though he were in a fever), 'say what you like, I am going farther\n",
        "off.'\n",
        "\n",
        "'Four ... five.... Good. Move away, my good fellow, move away; you may\n",
        "get behind a tree even, and stop up your ears, only don't shut your\n",
        "eyes; and if any one falls, run and pick him up. Six ... seven ...\n",
        "eight....' Bazarov stopped. 'Is that enough?' he said, turning to Pavel\n",
        "Petrovitch; 'or shall I add two paces more?'\n",
        "\n",
        "'As you like,' replied the latter, pressing down the second bullet.\n",
        "\n",
        "'Well, we'll make it two paces more.' Bazarov drew a line on the ground\n",
        "with the toe of his boot. 'There's the barrier then. By the way, how\n",
        "many paces may each of us go back from the barrier? That's an important\n",
        "question too. That point was not discussed yesterday.'\n",
        "\n",
        "'I imagine, ten,' replied Pavel Petrovitch, handing Bazarov both\n",
        "pistols. 'Will you be so good as to choose?'\n",
        "\n",
        "'I will be so good. But, Pavel Petrovitch, you must admit our combat is\n",
        "singular to the point of absurdity. Only look at the countenance of our\n",
        "second.'\n",
        "\n",
        "'You are disposed to laugh at everything,' answered Pavel Petrovitch.\n",
        "'I acknowledge the strangeness of our duel, but I think it my duty to\n",
        "warn you that I intend to fight seriously. _A bon entendeur, salut!_'\n",
        "\n",
        "'Oh! I don't doubt that we've made up our minds to make away with each\n",
        "other; but why not laugh too and unite _utile dulci_? You talk to me in\n",
        "French, while I talk to you in Latin.'\n",
        "\n",
        "'I am going to fight in earnest,' repeated Pavel Petrovitch, and he\n",
        "walked off to his place. Bazarov on his side counted off ten paces from\n",
        "the barrier, and stood still.\n",
        "\n",
        "'Are you ready?' asked Pavel Petrovitch.\n",
        "\n",

        "'We can approach one another.'\n",
        "\n",
        "Bazarov moved slowly forward, and Pavel Petrovitch, his left hand\n",
        "thrust in his pocket, walked towards him, gradually raising the muzzle\n",
        "of his pistol.... 'He's aiming straight at my nose,' thought Bazarov,\n",
        "'and doesn't he blink down it carefully, the ruffian! Not an agreeable\n",
        "sensation though. I'm going to look at his watch chain.'\n",
        "\n",
        "Something whizzed sharply by his very ear, and at the same instant\n",
        "there was the sound of a shot. 'I heard it, so it must be all right,'\n",
        "had time to flash through Bazarov's brain. He took one more step, and\n",
        "without taking aim, pressed the spring.\n",
        "\n",
        "Pavel Petrovitch gave a slight start, and clutched at his thigh. A\n",
        "stream of blood began to trickle down his white trousers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Bazarov flung aside the pistol, and went up to his antagonist. 'Are you\n",
        "wounded?' he said.\n",
        "\n",
        "'You had the right to call me up to the barrier,' said Pavel\n",
        "Petrovitch, 'but that's of no consequence. According to our agreement,\n",
        "each of us has the right to one more shot.'\n",
        "\n",
        "'All right, but, excuse me, that'll do another time,' answered Bazarov,\n",
        "catching hold of Pavel Petrovitch, who was beginning to turn pale.\n",
        "'Now, I'm not a duellist, but a doctor, and I must have a look at your\n",
        "wound before anything else. Piotr! come here, Piotr! where have you got\n",
        "to?'\n",
        "\n",
        "'That's all nonsense.... I need no one's aid,' Pavel Petrovitch\n",
        "declared jerkily, 'and ... we must ... again ...' He tried to pull at\n",
        "his moustaches, but his hand failed him, his eyes grew dim, and he lost\n",
        "consciousness.\n",
        "\n",
        "'Here's a pretty pass! A fainting fit! What next!' Bazarov cried\n",
        "unconsciously, as he laid Pavel Petrovitch on the grass. 'Let's have a\n",
        "look what's wrong.' He pulled out a handkerchief, wiped away the blood,\n",
        "and began feeling round the wound.... 'The bone's not touched,' he\n",
        "muttered through his teeth; 'the ball didn't go deep; one muscle,\n",
        "_vastus externus_, grazed. He'll be dancing about in three weeks!...\n",
        "And to faint! Oh, these nervous people, how I hate them! My word, what\n",
        "a delicate skin!'\n",
        "\n",
        "'Is he killed?' the quaking voice of Piotr came rustling behind his\n",
        "back.\n",
        "\n",
        "Bazarov looked round. 'Go for some water as quick as you can, my good\n",
        "fellow, and he'll outlive us yet.'\n",
        "\n",
        "But the modern servant seemed not to understand his words, and he did\n",
        "not stir. Pavel Petrovitch slowly opened his eyes. 'He will die!'\n",
        "whispered Piotr, and he began crossing himself.\n",
        "\n",
        "'You are right ... What an imbecile countenance!' remarked the wounded\n",
        "gentleman with a forced smile.\n",
        "\n",
        "'Well, go for the water, damn you!' shouted Bazarov.\n",
        "\n",
        "'No need.... It was a momentary _vertigo_.... Help me to sit up ...\n",
        "there, that's right.... I only need something to bind up this scratch,\n",
        "and I can reach home on foot, or you can send a droshky for me. The\n",
        "duel, if you are willing, shall not be renewed. You have behaved\n",
        "honourably ... to-day, to-day--observe.'\n",
        "\n",
        "'There's no need to recall the past,' rejoined Bazarov; 'and as regards\n",
        "the future, it's not worth while for you to trouble your head about\n",
        "that either, for I intend being off without delay. Let me bind up your\n",
        "leg now; your wound's not serious, but it's always best to stop\n",
        "bleeding. But first I must bring this corpse to his senses.'\n",
        "\n",
        "Bazarov shook Piotr by the collar, and sent him for a droshky.\n",
        "\n",
        "'Mind you don't frighten my brother,' Pavel Petrovitch said to him;\n",
        "'don't dream of informing him.'\n",
        "\n",
        "Piotr flew off; and while he was running for a droshky, the two\n",
        "antagonists sat on the ground and said nothing. Pavel Petrovitch tried\n",
        "not to look at Bazarov; he did not want to be reconciled to him in any\n",
        "case; he was ashamed of his own haughtiness, of his failure; he was\n",
        "ashamed of the whole position he had brought about, even while he felt\n",
        "it could not have ended in a more favourable manner. 'At any rate,\n",
        "there will be no scandal,' he consoled himself by reflecting, 'and for\n",
        "that I am thankful.' The silence was prolonged, a silence distressing\n",
        "and awkward. Both of them were ill at ease. Each was conscious that the\n",
        "other understood him. That is pleasant to friends, and always very\n",
        "unpleasant to those who are not friends, especially when it is\n",
        "impossible either to have things out or to separate.\n",
        "\n",
        "'Haven't I bound up your leg too tight?' inquired Bazarov at last.\n",
        "\n",
        "'No, not at all; it's capital,' answered Pavel Petrovitch; and after a\n",
        "brief pause, he added, 'There's no deceiving my brother; we shall have\n",
        "to tell him we quarrelled over politics.'\n",
        "\n",
        "'Very good,' assented Bazarov. 'You can say I insulted all\n",
        "anglomaniacs.'\n",
        "\n",
        "'That will do capitally. What do you imagine that man thinks of us\n",
        "now?' continued Pavel Petrovitch, pointing to the same peasant, who had\n",
        "driven the hobbled horses past Bazarov a few minutes before the duel,\n",
        "and going back again along the road, took off his cap at the sight of\n",
        "the 'gentlefolk.'\n",
        "\n",
        "'Who can tell!' answered Bazarov; 'it's quite likely he thinks nothing.\n",
        "The Russian peasant is that mysterious unknown about whom Mrs.\n",
        "Radcliffe used to talk so much. Who is to understand him! He doesn't\n",
        "understand himself!'\n",
        "\n",
        "'Ah! so that's your idea!' Pavel Petrovitch began; and suddenly he\n",
        "cried, 'Look what your fool of a Piotr has done! Here's my brother\n",
        "galloping up to us!'\n",
        "\n",
        "Bazarov turned round and saw the pale face of Nikolai Petrovitch, who\n",
        "was sitting in the droshky. He jumped out of it before it had stopped,\n",
        "and rushed up to his brother.\n",
        "\n",
        "'What does this mean?' he said in an agitated voice. 'Yevgeny\n",
        "Vassilyitch, pray, what is this?'\n",
        "\n",
        "'Nothing,' answered Pavel Petrovitch; 'they have alarmed you for\n",
        "nothing. I had a little dispute with Mr. Bazarov, and I have had to pay\n",
        "for it a little.'\n",
        "\n",
        "'But what was it all about, mercy on us!'\n",
        "\n",
        "'How can I tell you? Mr. Bazarov alluded disrespectfully to Sir Robert\n",
        "Peel. I must hasten to add that I am the only person to blame in all\n",
        "this, while Mr. Bazarov has behaved most honourably. I called him out.'\n",
        "\n",
        "'But you're covered with blood, good Heavens!'\n",
        "\n",
        "'Well, did you suppose I had water in my veins? But this blood-letting\n",
        "is positively beneficial to me. Isn't that so, doctor? Help me to get\n",
        "into the droshky, and don't give way to melancholy. I shall be quite\n",
        "well to-morrow. That's it; capital. Drive on, coachman.'\n",
        "\n",
        "Nikolai Petrovitch walked after the droshky; Bazarov was remaining\n",
        "where he was....\n",
        "\n",
        "'I must ask you to look after my brother,' Nikolai Petrovitch said to\n",
        "him, 'till we get another doctor from the town.'\n",
        "\n",
        "Bazarov nodded his head without speaking. In an hour's time Pavel\n",
        "Petrovitch was already lying in bed with a skilfully bandaged leg. The\n",
        "whole house was alarmed; Fenitchka fainted. Nikolai Petrovitch kept\n",
        "stealthily wringing his hands, while Pavel Petrovitch laughed and\n",
        "joked, especially with Bazarov; he had put on a fine cambric\n",
        "night-shirt, an elegant morning wrapper, and a fez, did not allow the\n",
        "blinds to be drawn down, and humorously complained of the necessity of\n",
        "being kept from food.\n",
        "\n",
        "Towards night, however, he began to be feverish; his head ached. The\n",
        "doctor arrived from the town. (Nikolai Petrovitch would not listen to\n",
        "his brother, and indeed Bazarov himself did not wish him to; he sat the\n",
        "whole day in his room, looking yellow and vindictive, and only went in\n",
        "to the invalid for as brief a time as possible; twice he happened to\n",
        "meet Fenitchka, but she shrank away from him with horror.) The new\n",
        "doctor advised a cooling diet; he confirmed, however, Bazarov's\n",
        "assertion that there was no danger. Nikolai Petrovitch told him his\n",
        "brother had wounded himself by accident, to which the doctor responded,\n",
        "'Hm!' but having twenty-five silver roubles slipped into his hand on\n",

        "happens, to be sure.'\n",
        "\n",
        "No one in the house went to bed or undressed. Nikolai Petrovitch kept\n",

        "latter dozed, moaned a little, told him in French, _Couchez-vous_, and\n",
        "asked for drink. Nikolai Petrovitch sent Fenitchka twice to take him a\n",
        "glass of lemonade; Pavel Petrovitch gazed at her intently, and drank\n",
        "off the glass to the last drop. Towards morning the fever had increased\n",
        "a little; there was slight delirium. At first Pavel Petrovitch uttered\n",
        "incoherent words; then suddenly he opened his eyes, and seeing his\n",
        "brother near his bed bending anxiously over him, he said, 'Don't you\n",

        "'the fine arts within a certain sphere,' and had in consequence put up\n",
        "in his garden, between the hothouse and the lake, an erection after the\n",
        "fashion of a Greek temple, made of Russian brick. Along the dark wall\n",
        "at the back of this temple or gallery were placed six niches for\n",
        "statues, which Odintsov had proceeded to order from abroad. These\n",
        "statues were to represent Solitude, Silence, Meditation, Melancholy,\n",
        "Modesty, and Sensibility. One of them, the goddess of Silence, with her\n",
        "finger on her lip, had been sent and put up; but on the very same day\n",
        "some boys on the farm had broken her nose; and though a plasterer of\n",
        "the neighbourhood undertook to make her a new nose 'twice as good as\n",
        "the old one,' Odintsov ordered her to be taken away, and she was still\n",
        "to be seen in the corner of the threshing barn, where she had stood\n",
        "many long years, a source of superstitious terror to the peasant women.\n",
        "The front part of the temple had long ago been overgrown with thick\n",
        "bushes; only the pediments of the columns could be seen above the dense\n",
        "green. In the temple itself it was cool even at mid-day. Anna Sergyevna\n",
        "had not liked visiting this place ever since she had seen a snake\n",
        "there; but Katya often came and sat on the wide stone seat under one of\n",
        "the niches. Here, in the midst of the shade and coolness, she used to\n",
        "read and work, or to give herself up to that sensation of perfect\n",
        "peace, known, doubtless, to each of us, the charm of which consists in\n",
        "the half-unconscious, silent listening to the vast current of life that\n",

        "\n",
        "There was about an hour still to lunch-time; the dewy morning had\n",
        "already given place to a sultry day. Arkady's face retained the\n",

        "attract the notice of her aunt and all the household. Besides this,\n",
        "even the previous evening Anna Sergyevna had not been herself; and\n",
        "Katya herself had felt ill at ease, as though she were conscious of\n",
        "some fault in herself. As she yielded to Arkady's entreaties, she said\n",

        "very important ... for me ... one question, which I have not touched\n",
        "upon up till now. You remarked yesterday that I have been changed\n",
        "here,' he went on, at once catching and avoiding the questioning glance\n",

        "look for my ideals where I did; they present themselves to me ... much\n",
        "closer to hand. Up till now I did not understand myself; I set myself\n",
        "tasks which were beyond my powers.... My eyes have been opened lately,\n",

        "\n",

        "stammered, and was forced to be silent for a moment. Katya still did\n",
        "not raise her eyes. She seemed not to understand what he was leading up\n",
        "to in all this, and to be waiting for something.\n",
        "\n",

        "remember, yesterday with a want of seriousness,' Arkady went on, with\n",
        "the air of a man who has got into a bog, feels that he is sinking\n",
        "further and further in at every step, and yet hurries onwards in the\n",
        "hope of crossing it as soon as possible; 'that reproach is often aimed\n",

        "along it escorted by Bazarov. Katya and Arkady could not see them, but\n",
        "they heard every word, the rustle of their clothes, their very\n",
        "breathing. They walked on a few steps, and, as though on purpose, stood\n",
        "still just opposite the temple.\n",
        "\n",
        "'You see,' pursued Anna Sergyevna, 'you and I made a mistake; we are\n",
        "both past our first youth, I especially so; we have seen life, we are\n",
        "tired; we are both--why affect not to know it?--clever; at first we\n",

        "it was to be, we had no need of one another, that's the chief point;\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "'The word _fascination_ is most usual in such cases,' Bazarov\n",
        "interrupted; the effervescence of his spleen could be heard in his\n",
        "choked though steady voice. 'Arkady was mysterious over something with\n",

        "his heart. He could scarcely stand on his feet, and could only repeat,\n",
        "'Katya, Katya ...' while she began weeping in a guileless way, smiling\n",
        "gently at her own tears. No one who has not seen those tears in the\n",

        "away.\n",
        "\n",
        "'The younger generation have grown awfully sly,' remarked Bazarov, and\n",
        "he too laughed. 'Good-bye,' he began again after a short silence. 'I\n",

        "capital thing. But you needn't have been such a humbug. I expected\n",

        "hay in; that's how it is in the box of our life; we would stuff it up\n",
        "with anything rather than have a void. Don't be offended, please; you\n",

        "not distress her, it interested her, it even softened her at last. Anna\n",
        "Sergyevna felt both glad and sorry at this. 'It is clear that Bazarov\n",

        "of his pipe, or, clutching his neck with his fingers, turned his head\n",
        "round, as though he were trying whether it were properly screwed on,\n",

        "He kept his promise. After installing his son as before in his study,\n",
        "he almost hid himself away from him, and he kept his wife from all\n",
        "superfluous demonstrations of tenderness. 'On Enyusha's first visit, my\n",
        "dear soul,' he said to her, 'we bothered him a little; we must be wiser\n",
        "this time.' Arina Vlasyevna agreed with her husband, but that was small\n",
        "compensation since she saw her son only at meals, and was now\n",
        "absolutely afraid to address him. 'Enyushenka,' she would say\n",
        "sometimes--and before he had time to look round, she was nervously\n",
        "fingering the tassels of her reticule and faltering, 'Never mind, never\n",

        "or beetroot-soup?'--'But why didn't you ask him yourself?'--'Oh, he\n",
        "will get sick of me!' Bazarov, however, soon ceased to shut himself up;\n",
        "the fever of work fell away, and was replaced by dreary boredom or\n",
        "vague restlessness. A strange weariness began to show itself in all his\n",
        "movements; even his walk, firm, bold and strenuous, was changed. He\n",
        "gave up walking in solitude, and began to seek society; he drank tea in\n",
        "the drawing-room, strolled about the kitchen-garden with Vassily\n",
        "Ivanovitch, and smoked with him in silence; once even asked after\n",
        "Father Alexey. Vassily Ivanovitch at first rejoiced at this change, but\n",
        "his joy was not long-lived. 'Enyusha's breaking my heart,' he\n",
        "complained in secret to his wife; 'it's not that he's discontented or\n",
        "angry--that would be nothing; he's sad, he's sorrowful--that's what's\n",
        "so terrible. He's always silent. If he'd only abuse us; he's growing\n",
        "thin, he's lost his colour.'--'Mercy on us, mercy on us!' whispered the\n",
        "old woman; 'I would put an amulet on his neck, but, of course, he won't\n",
        "allow it.' Vassily Ivanovitch several times attempted in the most\n",
        "circumspect manner to question Bazarov about his work, about his\n",
        "health, and about Arkady.... But Bazarov's replies were reluctant and\n",
        "casual; and, once noticing that his father was trying gradually to lead\n",
        "up to something in conversation, he said to him in a tone of vexation:\n",
        "'Why do you always seem to be walking round me on tiptoe? That way's\n",
        "worse than the old one.'--'There, there, I meant nothing!' poor Vassily\n",

        "\n",
        "'Arrears, no indeed, mate!' answered the first peasant, and now there\n",

        "reiterate, 'Not a matter of the first importance!' simply because his\n",
        "son, on hearing he was going to matins, had made use of that\n",

        "the idea of having such an assistant excited him to ecstasy, filled him\n",
        "with pride. 'Yes, yes,' he would say to some peasant woman in a man's\n",

        "Goulard's extract or a box of white ointment, 'you ought to be thanking\n",

        "\n",

        "wall. Vassily Ivanovitch gesticulated at his wife with both hands; she\n",
        "bit her lips so as not to cry, and went away. The whole house seemed\n",
        "suddenly darkened; every one looked gloomy; there was a strange hush; a\n",
        "shrill cock was carried away from the yard to the village, unable to\n",
        "comprehend why he should be treated so. Bazarov still lay, turned to\n",

        "amazement never left his face all through), and went back again to his\n",

        "reply; but to his own horror, instead of a smile, he found himself\n",
        "taken somehow by a fit of laughter. He had sent at daybreak for a\n",
        "doctor. He thought it necessary to inform his son of this, for fear he\n",
        "should be angry. Bazarov suddenly turned over on the sofa, bent a fixed\n",

        "they are opened for an instant, with the fresh faces, that look stung\n",
        "by the cold, and the hurrying trot of the chilled horses. A January day\n",

        "pardon; I'm not to blame.' And not she alone--all the others smiled,\n",
        "and also seemed apologetic; they were all a little awkward, a little\n",

        "humorous attentiveness, as though they had all agreed to rehearse a\n",
